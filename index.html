            <p>Kamotho Muriithi is a patriotic Kenyan Youth born and raised in Marmanet Ward, Laikipia County</p>
            <p>I am a believer in social democracy, good governance and the rule of law. For the 2022 race I am seeking the elective position
                as a Member of County Assembly representative, Marmanet Ward.

            <p>I hold a BA in Political  Science and Public Administration from Karatina University. As an intellect, I have and 
                does not mind challenging and changing the status quo. <br>The youth make up to 78.3% of the Kenyan 
                population. As such, the ability to bring change in our Kenyan political space, governance and entrenched 
            disparities rests solely in us. Come 2022, I urge all of us to make our vote count in the best way ever.</br></p>

                     <h1>Access to clean water. </h1>
                         <p>Article 43(1)(d) guarantees everybody a right to clean and safe water in adequate quantities. In Marmanet ward, this right hasn't been fully enjoyed. According to UNICEF, 43% of Kenyans cannot access clean water. The statics are even higher in this part of Laikipia. Towards that end, I intend to solve this problem by:
                            Sinking at least one borehole in a radius of 10 km. Rehabilitation of existing dams and dredging more.</p>

                      <p>Article 43 (1)(a) states: every person has a right to highest attainable standards of health... The healthcare system in Marmanet and by extension Laikipia is constantly threatened by lack of medicine and enough personnel. Equally, critical resources like ambulances aren't reliable. I intend to drive a policy intervention by the county government that will:  Ensure that hospitals are fully equipped and that nobody goes home to buy medicine. Pushing for more staff to attend to patients. Registering more people in the NHIF program.</p>
